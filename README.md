# Majed Abumathkour

University web development student at the Faculty of Information Technology,
Islamic University of Gaza (IUG), with a growing focus on backend development
and server-side systems.

I use this GitHub profile to document my learning journey through university
coursework, hands-on projects, and structured self-study, with an emphasis on
building solid foundations in backend concepts, databases, and web systems.

## Focus & Interests

My primary interest lies in backend development and server-side systems.
I focus on understanding how web applications work behind the scenes,
including data modeling, database interaction, and API-based communication.

Through university coursework and self-study, I have worked with SQL and
relational databases, explored REST-style APIs, and implemented basic
server-side logic using languages such as Python and Java. I am particularly
interested in building reliable backend foundations, rather than jumping
directly into frameworks without understanding the underlying concepts.

I approach backend development from a learning-first perspective, aiming to
strengthen my understanding of databases, application structure, and
backend-oriented problem solving.
